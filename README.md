# Adversarial-Training-on-CIFAR-10-by-Pytorch
* The repository contains implementaions of adversarial traning methods on CIFAR-10 by PyTorch

## Experiment Settings
* The basic experiment setting refers to the setting used in [Madry Laboratory](https://github.com/MadryLab/cifar10_challenge).
* Dataset: CIFAR-10 ( 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. )
* Attack method: PGD attack
